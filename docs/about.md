# About

Welcome to my blog! I am mostly interested in technology, gaming, shows, movies, and books. If you are too, you're in the right place.

I originally started this blog to make the world a little more human. I grew very tired of seeing so much AI-generated content. So, I'll use a fancy little admonition to write a promise:

!!! note "Promise"

    This blog will __always__ feature content written by my hands. Spelling, grammar, and general coherence will hopefully also be included.

    AI-generation may help with coding, but I won't continue to contribute to slopification of the internet by using it for prose.

If I break this promise, feel free to call me out. It at least will show me someone is reading!
